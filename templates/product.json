A dull knife or an unhygienic surface can ruin not just the dish, but the entire experience. Traditional cutting boards just didn't meet my standards. Driven by my commitment to quality, I created the Katuchef cutting board. Made from pure titanium, Katuchef is antibacterial, knife-friendly, and built to last a lifetime, whether you're cooking at home or in a professional kitchen.",
